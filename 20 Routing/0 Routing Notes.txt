Routing is a mechanism to move from one page to another page or we can say from one component to another component.


We have to create different component for each page
Then we have to make entry of each of the page in the app.routes.ts file along with their component.

then we have to import RouterOutlet and RouterLink in TS file

<router-outlet> is the element where the content will be visible.
